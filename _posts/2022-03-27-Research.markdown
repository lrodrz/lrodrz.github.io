### Current Activity: 


#### Mar-27-2022:

<p>I'm currently working on investigating the vibratinal frequencies of Kr-CO<sub>2</sub> and Ne-CO<sub>2</sub> Vibrational frequencey van der Waals complexes. </p><br>


### Why is this research important? 



<p>We begin our story with the Keeling Curve which shows the increasing emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> over time. This graph is correlated to the global trend of rising average temperatures. The keeling curve is composed of a few parts. First we see that there is a small sinosoidal pattern in the fine detail of the curve this wave pattern is due to the season variation, when the leaves bloom and die as the temperature changes over the four seasons: winter, spring, summer, fall. We see although there is a seasonal varation accouting for some wave patteren the overall trend of the curve is moving upward as we move from 1960 to 2020. </p>

#### So why is carbon dioxide such a big deal? 


<p>Well, it has to do with the absorption of energy of CO<sub>2</sub>. Carbon dioxide is an excellent absorber of energy. Sunlight, therefore, being a source of energy is absorbed by carbon dioxide and produces what is known as the greenhouse effect <sub>[2]</sub>.</p>

<p>Our study comes into play when we discuss the absorption of energy in CO<sub>2</sub>. According to Fomichev and co-workers, carbon dioxide absorbs sublight (solar energy) in the near infrared region of the electromagentic spectrum causing the molecule to excite into the anti-symmetric vibrational frequency mode.</p> 
<p>Think of vibrational frequencies and vibrating molecules kind of like how food is cooked in a microwave, we cook the food using a mirowave signal generated by the microwaves magnetron causing the rotation and vibration of the molecules of water in your food <sub>[3][4]</sub>. This same effect is happening with the solar radation from the sun hitting the carbon dioxide molecules in the atmosphere. </p>
<p>The work of the Sode Lab is the explain these vibrational excitations known as vibrational frequencies using computational theoretical chemistry and machine learning in van der Waals Complexes. In studying the van der Waals complexes we can study the vibrations of the carbon dioxide molecule and the impact that outside atoms and molecules affect its vibrational frequency. </p>
