<h2><u>A Kind Welcome: </u></h2>


Welcome to the blog! <u>The site is brand new (first published on March 27, 2022) and needs to go over many changes</u>,  but for now you can check out my post history below. For information about me check out the information tab on the header bar of this website or if you're on mobile, check out the hamburger menu on the right to see the menu options. For information about my research, visit the research page.

<h2><u>Picture of the Month: </u></h2>

Already with a full ambition and a lot of work ahead of me, I think that I will add some kind of photo of the month or something in this spot and comment on different photos that I find over the internet. This months photo features a nice clock tower taken more than a hundred years ago in the British Isles. A theme for this website is time so its only appropriate that one of the first featured photos feature a time keeping device.
