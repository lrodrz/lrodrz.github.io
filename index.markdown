<h2><u>A Kind Welcome: </u></h2>

Welcome to the blog! I launched this blog on March 27, 2022. This blog is intended to document my journey as a computational biophysicist and theoretical computational chemist. Here I plan to document my research and career progress. To learn more about me, please visit the "About Me" tab on the header bar of this website. I have also segmented my main research areas into separate pages that can be accessed from the header bar. If you are on mobile, you can access the menu options by clicking on the hamburger menu on the right. For information about my research, please visit the "Research" page.

This month I am showcasing a picture of the Fox Theater in Bakersfield, CA. This theater is in the heart of Bakersfield's downtown district just down the street from the Padre Hotel which is also another Bakersfield landmark. Since I visited the fox recently for a show, I decided to snap a photo to commemorate the moment.
