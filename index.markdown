<h2><u>Picture of the Month: </u></h2>
<!-- picture paragraph -->
<p>

This month I am showcasing a photo from my research lab at Cal State LA. On the board I am working on a problem from my statistics class where I prove that 

<div class="container">

$\text{log}[L(\lambda|\overrightarrow{x})] = l(\lambda|\overrightarrow{x}) = \left( \sum^{n}_{i=1}\right)\text{log}\lambda - n\lambda - \sum^{n}_{i=1}\text{log}x_{i}! $

</div>
