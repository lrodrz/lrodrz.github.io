<p>Picture: A picture of a Master Chief Pop! toy from the Halo Franchise in front of the blackboard at my research lab at Cal State LA. On the board I am working on a problem from my statistics class where I prove that $\text{log}[L(\lambda|\overrightarrow{x})] = l(\lambda|\overrightarrow{x}) = \left( \sum^{n}_{i=1}\right)\text{log}\lambda - n\lambda - \sum^{n}_{i=1}\text{log}x_{i}! $</p>
