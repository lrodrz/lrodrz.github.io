<h1>Genetic Engineering</h1>

Welcome to my page on genetic engineering! Here I will discuss my interests and work in this field. As a computational biophysicist, I specifically apply my technical skills towards understanding biomolecular systems. The particular focus of my research and my long-term interest is to understand and investigate gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, and their applications in medicine and biotechnology. This page will serve as a repository for some of my literature research, summaries, as well as just personal insights on genetic engineering.
