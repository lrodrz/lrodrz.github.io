<h2> Some Background on Me: </h2>

I am recent graduate in Biology and Biochemistry from California State University, Los Angeles and I hope to get into data science to analyze big data with one day analyzing gene editing through machine learning algorithms. Coming out of college, Here on this website I am documenting my process and progress as I move from recent graduate to professional researcher.

<h5>Abstract: The CO<sub>2</sub> van der Waals (vdW) complex is important to study because it can elucidate the physical nature of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. We developed a flexible-monomer two-body carbon dioxide-rare gas (Rg) <i> ab initio </i> potential energy surface (PES), extending the previous work in the Ar-CO<sub>2</sub>  vdW complex. We validated the PES for each Rg-CO<sub>2</sub>  (Rg = Ne and Kr) through a Tikhonov regularization against a training set and validated the PES on a test set of <i> ab initio </i> energies. The PES was used to compute the theoretical vibrational frequencies for both complexes. We compared our theoretical vibrational frequencies to band assignments found in experimental literature. We observed splitting in vibrational frequencies of the doubly degenerate $\nu_2$ modes of CO<sub>2</sub>  in the Krypton and Neon complexes.</h5>

<h2> Why Chronos? </h2> 

Albert Einstein once said that time is "a stubbornly persistent illusion". This blog and many other things I have made and modeled follow this same ideology. Thats why I picked the name Chronos for my blog. I name a lot of my projects after greek gods to stay into a theme and I thought Chronos was a fun name that comments on the time situation we all find ourselves in.
