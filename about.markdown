<h2><u> Some Background on Me: </u></h2>

I am recently admitted graduate student in Chemistry at California State University, Los Angeles working in Dr. Olaseni Sode's research lab in computational chemistry. I studied Biology and biochemistry as my undergraduate major at Cal State LA. My career goals include breaking into the data science and big data analysis industry and hope to one day analyze and investigate gene editing through machine learning algorithms for the prediction of <i>in vivo</i> interactions. This website is my accountability tracker for which I hope to enter much information about my experiences as well as create a repository for the knowledge and research that I discover.

<h2><u> My Experience: </u></h2>

I have studied and working in three research labs beginning with my first research lab in the fall of 2016. After gaining the opportunity to study as a research student, I discovered immediately that the elucidation and investigation of chemical and physical concepts was my passion. I have worked synthesizing and analyzing organic compounds for the inclusion of anticancer molecules for drug delivery and discovery, I have worked elucidating biochemical editing interactions using assays and protein immunoblots and I currently use computers to investigate the theoretical concepts of atomic and molecular interactions. I endeavor to become a polymath to ensure I synergize well with my colleagues, so I always volunteer to learn a new method, instrument, program, or theory to facilitate a gain in time and insight in the pursuit of intellectual excellence.

<h4><b>Title: Study of Vibrational Frequencies in CO<sub>2</sub> van der Waals Complexes, A Machine Learning Approach</b></h4>

<h4>Authors: Rodriguez, Larry. Olaseni, Sode.</h4>

<h5><u>Abstract</u>: The CO<sub>2</sub> van der Waals (vdW) complex is important to study because it can elucidate the physical nature of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. We developed a flexible-monomer two-body carbon dioxide-rare gas (Rg) <i> ab initio </i> potential energy surface (PES), extending the previous work in the Ar-CO<sub>2</sub>  vdW complex. We validated the PES for each Rg-CO<sub>2</sub>  (Rg = Ne and Kr) through a Tikhonov regularization against a training set and validated the PES on a test set of <i> ab initio </i> energies. The PES was used to compute the theoretical vibrational frequencies for both complexes. We compared our theoretical vibrational frequencies to band assignments found in experimental literature. We observed splitting in vibrational frequencies of the doubly degenerate $\nu_2$ modes of CO<sub>2</sub>  in the Krypton and Neon complexes.</h5>

<h4><b>Title: Pegylation of Î²-cyclodextrin for increased water solubility and biocompatibility in drug
delivery applications</b></h4>

<h4>Authors: Nguyen, Kim. Manasi, Roni. Rodriguez, Larry. Ba, Yong</h4>

<h5><u>Abstract</u>: Colloid 268; Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides that are (1, 4) linked -D(+)-glucopyranose units. CDs have a truncated cone-like shape with a relatively hydrophobic inner cavity and a hydrophilic exterior. Thus, CDs have been widely used as drug delivery carriers. -CD contains 7-D(+)-glucopyranoside units, and is the most commonly used CD in the pharmaceutical industry. However, -CDs drawbacks lie in its low water
solubility due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds among the secondary hydroxyl groups on the peripheries,
and the nephrotoxicity for drug delivery through parenteral administration. To tackle these adverse effects, we
have attached poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) to -CDs exterior region to render -CD the properties of
water solubility and biocompatibility. The synthesis of the pegylated -CDs was carried out by tosylating the
mPEG, de-protonating the hydroxyl groups on the -CD to form strong nucleophiles, and combining them
together through an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism to obtain the target compound, mPEG--CD. <sup>1</sup>H 2D COSY and NOESY
NMR, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry techniques were used to characterize the structures and molecular
weights of the products. We found that solubility of the pegylated -CDs was significantly improved. 1-
fluoroadamantane, a model drug, was used to examine the inclusion property of the pegylated -CD. The results
show that the cavities of pegylated -CDs were still open and available for drug loading. The increased water
solubility and drug loading capabilities of pegylated -CDs combined with PEGs biomedical properties predict
the promise of pegylated -CDs applications in the pharmaceutical industry.

<h2><u> Extracurricular: </u></h2> 

I consider a wide variety of hobbies and activities to keep myself occupied and strive to become a well rounded individual with a diverse skill set. With that being said, my hobbies include, woodworking, digital and film photography, jiujitsu, Judo, hiking, running, weight lifting, swimming, electronic prototyping, 3d printing, coding for fun, Gardening, and video games. 

<h2><u> Why Chronos? </u></h2> 

Albert Einstein once said that time is "a stubbornly persistent illusion". This blog and many other things I have made and modeled follow this same ideology. That's why I picked the name Chronos for my blog. I name a lot of my projects after Greek gods to stay into a theme and I thought Chronos was a fun name that comments on the time situation we all find ourselves in.
