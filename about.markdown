<h2><u> Some Background on Me: </u></h2>

I am recent graduate in Biology and Biochemistry from California State University, Los Angeles and I hope to get into data science to analyze big data with one day analyzing gene editing through machine learning algorithms. Coming out of college, Here on this website I am documenting my process and progress as I move from recent graduate to professional researcher.

<h4><b>Title: Study of Vibrational Frequencies in CO<sub>2</sub> van der Waals Complexes, A Machine Learning Approach</b></h4>

<h4>Authors: Rodriguez, Larry. Olaseni, Sode.</h4>

<h5><u>Abstract</u>: The CO<sub>2</sub> van der Waals (vdW) complex is important to study because it can elucidate the physical nature of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. We developed a flexible-monomer two-body carbon dioxide-rare gas (Rg) <i> ab initio </i> potential energy surface (PES), extending the previous work in the Ar-CO<sub>2</sub>  vdW complex. We validated the PES for each Rg-CO<sub>2</sub>  (Rg = Ne and Kr) through a Tikhonov regularization against a training set and validated the PES on a test set of <i> ab initio </i> energies. The PES was used to compute the theoretical vibrational frequencies for both complexes. We compared our theoretical vibrational frequencies to band assignments found in experimental literature. We observed splitting in vibrational frequencies of the doubly degenerate $\nu_2$ modes of CO<sub>2</sub>  in the Krypton and Neon complexes.</h5>

<h4><b>Title: Pegylation of Î²-cyclodextrin for increased water solubility and biocompatibility in drug
delivery applications</b></h4>

<h4>Authors: Nguyen, Kim. Manasi, Roni. Rodriguez, Larry. Ba, Yong</h4>

<h5><u>Abstract</u>: Colloid 268; Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides that are (1, 4) linked -D(+)-glucopyranose units. CDs have a truncated cone-like shape with a relatively hydrophobic inner cavity and a hydrophilic exterior. Thus, CDs have been widely used as drug delivery carriers. -CD contains 7-D(+)-glucopyranoside units, and is the most commonly used CD in the pharmaceutical industry. However, -CDs drawbacks lie in its low water
solubility due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds among the secondary hydroxyl groups on the peripheries,
and the nephrotoxicity for drug delivery through parenteral administration. To tackle these adverse effects, we
have attached poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) to -CDs exterior region to render -CD the properties of
water solubility and biocompatibility. The synthesis of the pegylated -CDs was carried out by tosylating the
mPEG, de-protonating the hydroxyl groups on the -CD to form strong nucleophiles, and combining them
together through an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism to obtain the target compound, mPEG--CD. <sup>1</sup>H 2D COSY and NOESY
NMR, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry techniques were used to characterize the structures and molecular
weights of the products. We found that solubility of the pegylated -CDs was significantly improved. 1-
fluoroadamantane, a model drug, was used to examine the inclusion property of the pegylated -CD. The results
show that the cavities of pegylated -CDs were still open and available for drug loading. The increased water
solubility and drug loading capabilities of pegylated -CDs combined with PEGs biomedical properties predict
the promise of pegylated -CDs applications in the pharmaceutical industry.

<h2><u> Extracurricular: </u></h2> 

I have a diverse set of extracurricular hobbies and activities that I have been involved with over the years. 

<h2><u> Why Chronos? </u></h2> 

Albert Einstein once said that time is "a stubbornly persistent illusion". This blog and many other things I have made and modeled follow this same ideology. That's why I picked the name Chronos for my blog. I name a lot of my projects after Greek gods to stay into a theme and I thought Chronos was a fun name that comments on the time situation we all find ourselves in.
