## Some Background on Me: 

I am recent graduate in Biology and Biochemistry from California State University, Los Angeles and I hope to get into data science to analyze big data with one day analyzing gene editing through machine learning algorithms. Coming out of college, Here on this website I am documenting my process and progress as I move from recent graduate to professional researcher.


## Why Chronos?  

Albert Einstein once said that time is "a stubbornly persistent illusion". This blog and many other things I have made and modeled follow this same ideology. Thats why I picked the name Chronos for my blog. I name a lot of my projects after greek gods to stay into a theme and I thought Chronos was a fun name that comments on the time situation we all find ourselves in.
