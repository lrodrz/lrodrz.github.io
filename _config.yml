# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

   Welcome to my personal website! Here I will be showcasing my personal 
   projects, work history, and experience. 
    Some background on me: I am recent graduate in Biology and Biochemistry 
  for California State University, Los Angeles and I hope to get into 
  data science to analyize big data with one day analyzing gene editing 
  through machine learning algorithms. Coming out of college, I belive that 
  I am only at the begining of my journey into this line of work and I hope 
  to learn as I go. Here on this website I am documenting my process. 
#  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
#  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
#  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "lrodrz.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
